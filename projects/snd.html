            Search & Destroy was on the Project Mayhem network. The game was a team game where players on each team would have to prime the enemy teams bomb while defending their own.
            When a bomb was armed, it would blow up after a minute, giving the team time to defuse their bomb. If a bomb blew up, all team members would instantly die. The last team standing would win.
            Players would earn credits based on their performance and could use those credits to buy a variety of kits to use.
