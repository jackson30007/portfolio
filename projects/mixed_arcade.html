            Mayhem Mania, later renamed to Mixed Arcade was a gamemode on the Project Mayhem network. It featured 27 unique fast-paced minigames. Each game would last around 3-5 minutes.
            Players would earn XP and level up based on their performance. Players could unlock kits they could use for each minigame, giving them small advantage.
        </p>
        <p>
            After Project Mayhem closed, this gamemode was re-released as a standalone server called Speedy Games. New minigames were added & tons of cosmetics were added, including emotes, victory dances, & more.
