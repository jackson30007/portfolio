            MCLobbies was a quick & easy to use minecraft hosting service. Players could join the server, and use the ingame menus to quickly setup a custom server for themselves & their friends.
            Customization options were available, including a list of plugins to choose from (w/ config editing ability), minecraft server version, a list of adventure maps to choose from, 
            and the ability to upload their own maps to their server.
        </p>
        <p>
            Everything was handled on the server, except uploading custom maps. When attempting uploading to a their own map, players would receive a URL to upload their map too.
            Once uploaded, players could create a server with their custom map.
