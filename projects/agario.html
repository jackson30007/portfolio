            Agar.io was on the Project Mayhem network. It was inspired by the browser game of the same name.
            The game involves circular blobs controlled by players fighting to become the biggest blob. Blobs can be grown by consuming pellets around the map, or by consuming smaller blobs by walking on top of them.
            You get slower the bigger you are & are able to split yourself into smaller blobs to gain a speed boost.
