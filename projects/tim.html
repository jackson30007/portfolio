            Time is Money Factions was a faction server on the Project Mayhem network with a unique twist. The currency of this game was time, and every second players would lose one second of their time.
            If a player ran out of time, they were death banned and would gain some time when their ban was over. Player's could sell any obtainable item at the shop area for time.
            The Factions system allowed everything classic factions does. You could claim land for your faction,
            you could ally other factions, you could set faction base to warp to. You could also add time to your faction's bank, which would tick down. If you have time in your faction bank, your claimed land would 
            not be raidable. However, players could damage your faction's bank by blowing up your territory with tnt.
