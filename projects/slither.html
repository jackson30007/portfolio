            Slither.io was on the Project Myahem network. It was inspired by the browser game of the same name.
            The game involves players riding their snake that is always moving. The longer your snake is, the wider you will turn. You can grow your snake by eating pellets around the map.
            If another snake runs its head into your snake, their body will turn into large pellets. Players can hold shift to gain a speed boost that recharges over time.
            You can gain XP by growing your snake, allowing you to level up and buy upgrades for your snake.
            The goal of the game is to become the longest snake.
