            MCInfected 2.0 was the first gamemode of what would become the Project Mayhem network. It was inspired by super-gaming's MCInfected that had since shut down.
            The game invovled survivors finding a hiding spot, and after a minute some players are randomly chosen to become "mother zombies."
            The mother zombies goal is to infect all survivors while the survivors goal to to survive until the match timer reaches zero.
            Survivors would earn cookies which they can use to rankup and start each round with better gear.
            After reaching the max rank, survivors could prestige, resetting their level in exchange for prestige tokens to spend in the prestige shop.

            Players could also unlock up to 21 infected kits. Each kit had 2 unique abilities that could be leveled up in unique ways, depending on the ability.
            Both abilities could be leveled up but players had to select only one of their abilities to get max level.
            Howerver, there was a weekly competition where the player who had the most kills on an infected class, would be the "infected king" and gain max level for both abilities for the week.
