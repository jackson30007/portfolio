            FearSG was a gamemode on the Project Mayhem network. It was a take on the Survival Games genre with a twist. Every player would get a compass & a unique target.
            Everyone's compass would constantly point to their target, giving each player the constant threat of being hunted. If a player's target was killed, they would get a new target.
            Getting kills & winning would award fear, which could be spent unlocking & upgrading kits.
