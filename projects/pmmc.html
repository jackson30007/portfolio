            The Project Myahem Network had many unique gamemodes, and was able to foster a dedicated community.
            The network had 450k+ unique joins and a peak of over 300 concurrent players.
            My role was the lead developer in a very small team. I was the only consistent developer and had to do the majority of dev work.
            Working on Project Mayhem was my first big project and due to the small team, I had to learn a ton while on the job.
